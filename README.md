* This data was scraped using Python in google colab and code was generated using chatGPT in 3 steps with the data frame provided in the question along with a personal access token. 
* The most interesting thing was the Bio that people had set, reflecting their unique personal nature on a platform that is no paper not a social media site. 
* Developers should leverage the resources available such as chatgpt4.0, Claude.ai, Intellisense etc as it makes coding with Python very easy, as the logic generated is easily manipulated and the AI ensures there are no syntax issues, leaving the human to focus on the logic being set
