* This data was scraped using Python in google colab and code was generated using chatGPT in 3 steps with the data frame provided in the question along with a personal access token. The files which were created at the end of the code were then taken to google sheets, where i used the inbuilt data analysis feature to give data cleanup recommendations and proceeded to use pivot table to answer the questions. A few questions for regression and corelation were answered by creating python scripts to generate the answer. 
* The most interesting thing was that generating python scripts to answer questions will often lead to in-correct answers on the first try, depending on how you specify excpetion handling, such as consider blank as false, ignore blanks etc. Rather than just focusing on execution, it is more important to focus on the set-up as the execution can now be aided by genAI. 
* Developers should leverage the resources available such as chatgpt4.0, Claude.ai, Intellisense etc as it makes coding with Python very easy, as the logic generated is easily manipulated and the AI ensures there are no syntax issues, leaving the human to focus on the logic being set.
